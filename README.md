# Combinatorial_libraries_and_labautomation


This is the work that I've have made during my master thesis at DTU. 

This repo consists of three notebooks:

1. Selection of Homologs
2. Selection of Promoters
3. Combinatorial library construction and lab-automation

On top of that two .py files are included which contain: 

1. DesignAssembly class - Can create combinatorial libraries
2. RobotAssembly class - Can automate generation of liquid handler instructions 

Finally, the data that I have used for this project is included in the data folder and pictures that are used in the notebooks can be found in the picture folder.
